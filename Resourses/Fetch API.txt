// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ //

/*

    fetch is a modern way to fetch data ot make api calls easyer than what we are using previously.
    
    They will implement promises internally.

    They will return a failure promise only when the network is not available to make an API call.

    They will return a successful promise when the network is available to make an API call.

    Based on response code from server, we will get to know if the server sent a successful response or not..........
